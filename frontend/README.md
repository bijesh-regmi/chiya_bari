# Video Platform Frontend

Basic React frontend for the video sharing platform.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000

## Features Implemented

- **Authentication**: Login and Register
- **Video Management**: Upload, View videos
- **Channel Pages**: View channel profiles, subscribe/unsubscribe
- **User Profile**: Update profile, avatar, cover image
- **Subscriptions**: View subscribed channels
- **Home**: Browse videos

## API Integration

All API calls are made to `/api/v1` endpoints. Make sure the backend is running on port 8000 (or update the proxy in `vite.config.js`).

## Note

This is a basic implementation focusing on functionality rather than UI/UX. The styling is minimal and can be enhanced as needed.
